### A spoof voice-call app written for the Psion Series 3a ###

Originally written in 1996 in Psion OPL.

At the time I was using a Psion Series 3a along with the Vodafone "Telenote" app to send/receive SMS messages from the Psion via an attached Nokia GSM/PCN phone. I created this app as a prank to fool my colleagues at the time that I could also make/receive voice calls via the Psion/Nokia combo.

The app pretends to connect to the attached mobile network, allows the  user to enter a number and uses the built-in tone generator to play dial/MF/ringing tones. The app then plays a .WVE file that sounds like someone has picked up/answered the call. This file can be re-recorded/customised so you can have whoever/whatever you like answering your fake call :-D

Only tested on Series 3a - for 3c/mx YMMV!

## **Disclaimer**: 
This repo is just a clone of the complete PHONEY folder that I found backed-up on a floppy (yes, an actual floppy disk!) and it's here for archival purposes only. If you wish to translate your own version you'll need to be familiar with intermediate/advanced programming in OPL for SIBO/EPOC16 computers. 

  
Also contained here are a lot of the (DOS) tools used to create this on a PC: S3ATRAN.EXE translator, WSPCX.EXE Psion PIC bitmap converter/combiner, AKA.EXE code obfuscator and Jezar's help compiler for OPL.

Oh and BTW *cxf@cix.compulink.co.uk* is long-dead too.


ENJOY!
